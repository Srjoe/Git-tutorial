In HTML, Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) characters can be displayed using character references 
or directly in the document. UTF-8 is the most commonly used encoding for HTML documents, allowing a wide range
 of characters from various languages and symbol sets to be represented.

Here's how you can include UTF characters in HTML:

Character References: You can use numeric character references or named character references to represent
 UTF characters. Numeric character references are specified using the "&#x" prefix followed by the hexadecimal 
 value of the character, while named character references use predefined names for commonly used characters.

Direct Input: You can also directly input UTF characters into your HTML document if the file is encoded in 
 UTF-8 or another compatible encoding. This allows you to include characters from various languages and symbol
  sets directly without the need for character references.

Meta Charset Declaration: Ensure that your HTML document includes a meta tag specifying the character 
encoding, particularly if you are using characters beyond the ASCII range. This helps browsers correctly 
interpret and display the characters.

Using UTF characters in HTML allows for greater flexibility in representing text and symbols from different 
languages and cultures. However, it's essential to ensure proper encoding and handling to avoid rendering 
issues across different platforms and browsers.
